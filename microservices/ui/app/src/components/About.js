      <p className="mb-5">I am a self taught front end developer and just went through 10 week intensive bootcamp at the Wyncode Academy<br />
         in Miami to deepen my knowledge of back end development.</p>
        <p>
        At the end of a course, me and my teammate won a final project competition.</p>
        <p>
        I have full confidence I can bring value to your company, adapt to a new environment,<br />
        learn new skill if needed and deliver the result!</p>
        <p>
I am detail-oriented, organized and dependable developer<br />
with experience in designing and building applications.</p>
<p>
I like new projects and challenges they bring!</p>
